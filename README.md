This is a script for Blender, that quickly appends a tool rig to the R6 IK + FK Blender Rig by Aeresei.

<bold> Steps: </bold>

Using Blender plugin in Roblox Studio, export a rig of a character attached to the tool (I guess you don't really need the character rig actually).

When importing to blender, move everything into a collection "Tool".
"Handle" - Tool object
"ToolArmature" - The armature of the exported rig (If you exported with a character, delete all bones except for the Handle bone)
